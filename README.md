# pigLatinTranslator - pure JS and CSS

Pig Latin refers to a game that alters the word given by the user.
Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an “ay”, 
or if a word begins with a vowel, you just add “way” to the end.
